In this certificate i learned how to use keybord shortcuts for financial modelling and how we can speed speed up our analysis using keybord instead of mouse. Important formulas were taught for analysis for e.g sumproduct, yearfrac, roundoffs(decimal and multiples) etc. keybord shortcuts for formatting the model and tracing precedents and dependets were also taught.
