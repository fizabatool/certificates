For first certificate, concepts behind Regression and classification machine learning algorithms were explained.

For second certificate, i learned how to use keybord shortcuts for financial modelling, and how we can speed up our analysis using keybord instead of a mouse. Important formulas were taught for analysis for e.g sumproduct, yearfrac, roundoffs(decimal and multiples) etc. keybord shortcuts for formatting the model and tracing of precedents and dependets were also taught.
